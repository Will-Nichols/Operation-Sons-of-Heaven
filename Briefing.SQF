                "In the year 2025 China and Russia brokered a deal to allow China National Petroleum Corporation, or CNPC who is the second-biggest Chinese crude oil producer, to begin exploration of the Beketov region of Siberia for the purposes of sharing the wealth between the two nations. CNPC competing bid against Rosneft has been rumored to be valued slightly more than $2 Trillion USD over a 20 year period. However CNPC did contract with Rosneft, Transneft and Bashneft to establish the oil field, refinery and pipelines that would feed the refined products to the western part of Russia and south to China. This additional contract has been valued to be slightly more than $900 Billion USD and the work is expected to be completed by 2030. In 2029 the Chinese MSS began sending operatives into the region that posed as workers within the key facilities that were coming online after Rosneft built them. The Chinese Politburo had planned all along to utilize the Russian and limited US backed petroleum concerns to do the vast majority of the work on the systems and processing facilities without allowing them to reap their rewards as those payments were due to be paid to the various companies in December of 2030. In January of 2030 the 15th PLA Airborne Division began manuevers near the northern border between China and Russia as part of a scheduled joint exercise with Russia. As part of the agreement there were observers on both sides of the border to watch and ensure that neither nation crossed the border or left the proscribed manuevers areas. These drills ended at the end of February 2030 and both nations began a stand down to allow troops and equipment to rest and be repaired. This stand down existed until late March and then the PLA began perparations to return the 15th to the Guangzou region by aircraft; but instead of flying south on the 30th of March the transports went north and dropped the first wave of paratroopers in the far southeastern region of Beketov. For the first few days these paraptroopers fought outgunned and on unfamiliar ground but they pervailed and held fast long enough for the heavy armored divisions to move north across unprepared terrain. These forces linked up on the 14th of April 2030...<br/><br/>
				
				(2) Capabilities: Russian 35th Army and the 11th Air and Air Defense forces, elements of the 5th Red Banner Army are staging now and are preparing to move eastward as soon as they are completely mobilized. The 35th Army forces are moving their recently trained units forward at a rapid pace and should be in the area just west of the Chinese pocket by the morning of the 15th. Shortly after the Chinese 15th Airborne dropped in the region the The 11th and 83rd Guards Air Assault Brigades of the VDV paradropped about 10Km west of the Chinese position in the early morning hours of April 1st. These forces have been fighting an slow retreat to allow the 35th Army forces time to get into position. It is expected that these troops will take higher than 60% losses and will be combat ineffective by the time the 35th Army arrives on scene in the battlespace .<br/><br/>(3) Most Probable Course of Action: As of this time the Chinese forces are able to push forward relatively unhampered by the VDV forces in the area. However it is possible that the Russian forces will utilize tactical nuclear weapons to stem the flow of Chinese forces westward. These weapons are extremely difficult to track as the weapon systems are man portable and the 35th Army operates with the 16th Independent NBC Defense Brigade. It is believed that these weapons are stockpiled in the areas around the Eastern Military Command HQ and they are deployed by the Spetznaz units stationed in the Eastern Military District which as the 14th and 24th Spetznaz Brigades. If these weapons are utilized it will create mass chaos around the world. a detachment of the South Blade Special Operations team are being dispatched to Beketov to assist in HVT operations against high ranking Russian commanders and important military targets such as these tactical nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>b. Friendly Forces - Task Force Red:<br/><br/>Chinese PLA Forces will utilize the callsigns, Phantom and Firehawk. These forces will be responsible for all ground and air combat operations within Beketov.<br/><br/>"
